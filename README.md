razzle
======

A documentation site for .NET assemblies generated off the XML documentation and the assembly. 

Mainly for my personal stuff, but you may find it useful. I have copied/pasted the code into multiple projects so I made this.

Why is it called Razzle?
======
Because that was the first thing that popped in my head when I created the github project.

But where can I see it working?
======

You can see a [live demo](http://razzle.bit13.com) at [http://razzle.bit13.com](http://razzle.bit13.com). The demo site is a 
deployed version of this source code.
